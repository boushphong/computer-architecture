A Computer System consists of hardware and systems software that work together to run application programs.

``` --hello.c
#include <stdio.h> 
int main()
{
    printf("hello, world\n");
    return 0;
}
```

The _hello_ program begins life as a source program (or source file) that the programmer creates with an editor and saves it as a text file called **hello.c**. The source program is a sequence of bits, each with a value of 0 or 1, organized in 8-bit chunks called bytes. Each byte represents some text character in the program.

Most computer systems represent text characters using the ASCII standard that represents each character with a unique byte-size integer value. The image above shows the ASCII representation of the **hello.c** program.
