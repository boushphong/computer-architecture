A Computer System consists of hardware and systems software that work together to run application programs.

``` --hello.c
#include <stdio.h> 
int main()
{
    printf("hello, world\n");
    return 0;
}
```

## 1.1 Information is Bits + Context

The _hello_ program begins life as a source program (or source file) that the programmer creates with an editor and saves it as a text file called **hello.c**. The source program is a sequence of bits, each with a value of 0 or 1, organized in 8-bit chunks called bytes. Each byte represents some text character in the program.

Most computer systems represent text characters using the ASCII standard that represents each character with a unique byte-size integer value. The image above shows the ASCII representation of the **hello.c** program.

The **hello.c** program is stored in a file as sequence of bytes. Each byte has an interger value that corresponds to some character. For example, "#" represents the integer value of 35, "i" represents the integer value 105 and so on. Each text line is terminated by the invisible newline character "\n", which is represented by the integer value of 10. Files such as **hello.c** that consist exclusively of ASCII characters are known as text files. All other files are known as binary files.

The representation of **hello.c** illustrates a _fundamental idea_: All information in a system - including disk files, programs stored in memory, user data stored in memory, and data transferred across a network - is represented as a bunch of bits. The only thing that distinguishes different data objects is the context in whcih we view them. For example, in different contexts, the same sequence of bytes might represent an integerm floating-point number, character string or machine instruction.

## 1.2 Programs are translated by other programs into different forms

The **hello** program begins life as a high-level C program because it can be read and understood by human beings in that form. However, in order to run **hello.c** on the system, the individual C statements must be translated by other programs into a sequence of _low-level machine-language_ instructions. These instructions are then packaged in a form called an _executable object program_ and stored as a binary disk file. Object programs are also referred to as executable object files.

On a UNIX system, the  translation from the source file is performed by a compiler driver.

linux> gcc -o hello hello.c

Here, the gcc compiler driver reads the source file **hello.c** and translates it into an executable file _hello_. The translation is performed in the sequence of four phases in Figure 1.3. The programs that perform the four phases (preprocessor, compiler, assembler, and linker) are known collectively as the _compilation system_.
